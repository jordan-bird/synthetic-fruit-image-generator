# :lemon: Synthetic Lemon Image Generator :lemon:
![Synthetic mouldy lemons generated by a Conditional GAN](preview.jpg)

This code utilises a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network which has been trained on healthy and unhealthy lemons 


## :lemon: What does this code do? :lemon:
This program loads a trained CGAN and then can generate synthetic images of either healthy or unhealthy classed lemons. We did this for data augmentation purposes.

## :lemon: Requirements :lemon:
* NumPy
* Keras

I used NumPy v1.19.3 and Keras v2.4.3 with TensorFlow 2.4.0 backend, but most versions should work

## :lemon: How do I use this? :lemon:
Simply run either:
```
python generate_lemons.py --type=healthy
```
or:
```
python generate_lemons.py --type=unhealthy
```

Then, 1000 jpg files will be generated of lemons that are either healthy or unhealthy

## :lemon: Training info :lemon:
The CGAN was trained on 256x256px images for 2000 epochs on an RTX 2080Ti which took around 17 hours. More info is available in the paper below

## :lemon: References :lemon:

This model was developed for the following research paper: *I'll add a link soon when the preprint is uploaded*

Trained on the [Lemons quality control dataset](https://github.com/softwaremill/lemon-dataset)

Generator code from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/)

(Jason Brownlee's code has been edited to support larger RGB images, and the program requires the definition of the class by the user)

You can do whatever you want with my model, it's completely open source provided you cite our work! *I'll add a link soon when the preprint is uploaded*
